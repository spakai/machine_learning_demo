# AI Agent Instructions for machine_learning_demo

## Project Overview
This is a machine learning project implementing a single-feature regression model to predict ice cream sales based on temperature data. The project serves as a demonstration of basic machine learning concepts.

## Project Structure
Currently, the project is in its initial setup phase. The main components that will be developed include:

- Data processing and analysis scripts
- Model training implementation
- Evaluation metrics and visualization
- Model deployment and prediction interface

## Development Guidelines

### Python Environment
- Use Python 3.x
- Dependencies will be managed through requirements.txt
- Virtual environment recommended for isolation

### Machine Learning Implementation
- Target: Regression model for ice cream sales prediction
- Feature: Temperature as single input variable
- Expected to implement standard ML workflow:
  1. Data preprocessing
  2. Model training
  3. Evaluation
  4. Prediction

### Code Organization
Recommended structure for implementation:
```
machine_learning_demo/
├── data/              # Dataset storage
├── src/              
│   ├── preprocessing/ # Data cleaning and preparation
│   ├── models/       # Model implementation
│   └── utils/        # Helper functions
├── notebooks/        # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
├── tests/           # Unit tests
└── README.md        # Project documentation
```

### Best Practices
1. Document data preprocessing steps clearly
2. Include model evaluation metrics
3. Provide example usage in notebooks
4. Maintain reproducible training pipeline

## Notes for AI Agents
- Project is in early stages - focus on establishing proper ML project structure
- Consider implementing both simple linear regression and more advanced models
- Include visualization components for data analysis and model performance
- Ensure reproducibility of results through proper seed setting and documentation
